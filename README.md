The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Apache Spark.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut.git
```

You can then build The Archives Unleashed Toolkit.

```
$ mvn clean install
```

For the impatient, to skip tests:

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is built against CDH 5.7.1:

+ Hadoop version: 2.6.0-cdh5.7.1
+ Spark version: 1.6.0-cdh5.7.1

The Hadoop ecosystem is evolving rapidly, so there may be incompatibilities with other versions.
