The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and makes use of [Sparkling](https://github.com/internetarchive/Sparkling) for parsing W/ARC records. The toolkit provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing. It is part of the [Archives Unleashed Project](http://archivesunleashed.org/).

To learn more about the Toolkit and how to use, please see our [comprehensive documentation](https://aut.docs.archivesunleashed.org/).
